{"name":"hearthstone-os","tagline":"an open source hearthstone clone","body":"***\r\n### Heyo!\r\nHearthstone-OS is a project that I started in my free time. I've always wondered what it would be like to mod hearthstone. I couldn't figure it out, so I just made my own copy! \r\n\r\n### Can I play it?\r\nYou can download the repo and compile it yourself. Hearthstone-OS is made in Java, and the current git holds the eclipse configs. I'll create an actual build once I migrate off the console.\r\n\r\n### Is this allowed?\r\nI have no idea. Blizzard owns every right to contact me and take this down if they want to. Hopefully they don't. I take no credit for the creation of the ideas in Hearthstone.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
